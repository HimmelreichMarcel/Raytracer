## Raytracer C++
=================================

### Basic Ray Tracing

The basic ray tracing model is as follows. A camera is placed in the world and rays are cast from the camera's position to points on an imaginary image plane. A ray is used to determine what light would be going towards the camera at that point and direction. In our case each ray represents a pixel in the output image and the resulting color of the ray determines the color output for the pixel.
